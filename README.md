# Project-Aliya-Mobile-App-

This app was designed as part of a meteorological setup at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science an Technology by the company I am interning with: Erictronics.
The project is called Aliya.

The orginal work was done by @Akora-Ing-DKB and was editted by me.
The app was never used because there was not enough memory on our Atmega328 to write the program for the GSM communication.

The App was supposed to send commands to the system via SMS.
